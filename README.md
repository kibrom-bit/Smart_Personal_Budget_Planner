# Smart Personal Budget Planner

## Model-Driven Development (MDD) Process

This project employed a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach using Eclipse. The process followed these steps:

1. **UML Diagram Creation:** UML diagrams (Class and Sequence) were created using Eclipse Papyrus to model the system.

    *Example Class Diagram:*
    ![Class Diagram](MDD/class diagram/class_diagram.png) *(Replace with actual path)*

    *Example Sequence Diagram:*
    ![Sequence Diagram](MDD/sequence diagram/sequence_diagram.png) *(Replace with actual path)*

2. **Java Code Generation (Eclipse):**  Eclipse's code generation capabilities were used to create initial Java class skeletons directly from the UML Class diagram. The following Java classes were generated (based on the system features):

    * `UserManager` (from User Management)
    * `BudgetManager` (from Budget Management)
    * `ExpenseTracker` (from Expense Tracking)
    * `SavingsGoalManager` (from Savings Goals)


3. **Business Logic Implementation:** The generated Java classes were then populated with the specific business logic for the Smart Personal Budget Planner application.

4. **Version Control (Git):** The project's code, including the generated and implemented classes, was managed using Git.
